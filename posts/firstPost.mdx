Welcome to this very informative and interesting blog lmao. Here's why its very nice:

- It uses markdown for *Nice* looking **text**
- Not only that but I can also embed `code` like this:

```javascript
const welcomeText = "Hello world!"
console.log(welcomeText)
```
- lol it's just overcomplicated and I'll never use it probably but I had fun making it ðŸ˜„

And much more... <br/>
.mxd ftw ðŸ”¥
